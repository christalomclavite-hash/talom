Choose ONE of these methods to run the app:

METHOD 1 - PHP built-in server (if PHP is installed)
-------------------------------------------------
Open PowerShell in this folder and run:
php -S localhost:8000 router.php

Then open in your browser:
http://localhost:8000

TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------
Q: "php not found" or "node not found"
A: Install PHP (7.4+) or Node.js and try again. The project can run with the PHP built-in server or the included Node example server.

Q: White screen or errors in browser
A: Check browser developer tools console (F12) for errors.

Q: Database errors
A: The SQLite DB is created automatically. If you get errors, delete `db/app.db` and let it recreate.
